Need to install in our system:
  Github Desktop / Git Bash
  Python 3
  
To run Django prefer to use the Virtual Environment:
  pip install virtualenv

Making and Activating the Virtual Environment:
  virtualenv “name as you like”
  source env/bin/activate

Installing Django:
  pip install django

Now, we need to clone any Django project from Github:
  Put the git URL and press clone.

After finishing the cloning:
  Install the project dependencies:
    pip install -r requirement.txt

Make a demo project just to copy the SECRET KEY generated by Django.
To create:
  open CMD and type django-admin startproject “name of the project”
  Now go to the setting.py and copy the SECRET_KEY.
  Navigate to the cloned folder and open the setting.py and paste the copied SECRET_KEY.
  Then open the cmd in that folder and do the migration part and also create the superuser by the following commands.

Now the last thing is that just go to the cloned project and run the project by writing the following command in the CMD.
  python manage.py runserver
